  "College savers: Saving for college is one of the biggest expenses parents face. Saving for students should be a marathon, not a sprint. An FDIC-insured savings account is a safe place to save for your child’s college education. Eventually, you might want to consider moving some money into a CD — depending on when your child is starting college.",
  "Future retirees: A savings account is one of the vehicles that should be used to prepare for retirement and should be a part of your retirement plan.",
